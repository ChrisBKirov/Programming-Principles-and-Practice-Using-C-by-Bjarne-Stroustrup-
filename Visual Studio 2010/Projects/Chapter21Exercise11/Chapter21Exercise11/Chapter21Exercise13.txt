Dos and don'ts is an especially unusual exception.
The apostrophe in the contraction don't seems to 
make people want to use an apostrophe to make	 
plural (do's and don'ts), but then to be consistent,
you'd also have to use an apostrophe to make don't
plural, which becomes downright ugly (do's and don't's).
