The IP host address, or more commonly just IP address,
is used to identify hosts connected to the Internet.
IP stands for Internet Protocol and refers to the
Internet Layer of the overall network architecture of the Internet.

An IP address is a 32-bit quantity interpreted as 48-bit numbers or octets.
Each IP address uniquely identifies the participating user network,
the host on the network, and the class of the user network.

An IP address is usually written in a dotted-decimal notation 
of the form N1.N2.N3.N4, where each Ni is a decimal number
between 0 and 255 decimal (00 through FF hexadecimal).
