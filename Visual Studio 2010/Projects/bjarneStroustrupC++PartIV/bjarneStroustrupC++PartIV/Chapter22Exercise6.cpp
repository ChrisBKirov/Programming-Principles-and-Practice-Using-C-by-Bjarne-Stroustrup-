TITLE		   Program in every language		    			Chapter22Exercise6.cpp
COMMEN
	Objective: For each language mentioned in this chapter, look at a popular textbook
			   and see what is used as the first complete program. 
			   Write that program in all of the other languages. 
			   Warning: This could easily be a 1OO - program project.

			   List of programming languages:
					Ada		Fortran
					Algol	Lisp
					BCPL	Pascal
					C		Scheme
					COBOL	Simula

			   In this file there will be 9 programs from the rest of 
			   the progtamming languages.

			   Rest of languages could be compiled at:
			   https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm
			   or
			   https://ideone.com/

			   A file containing folder per different language could be found at:
			   D:\C++ Projects\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\Chapter22Exercise6
