/*
	C features not found in C++
		- variabale-length arrays.
		- casting from T* to void*.				(C++ is strongly types.)
		- designated initializers for struct.   (C++ has constructors.)
		- compound literals.
		- variables with names - keywords in C++, but not in C.
		- type-generic macros.				    (C++ has function overloading.)
		- less complex compilers due to simple syntax.
		- functions with unspecified parameters.
		- function with missing return statement is OK.
		- anonymous structs.
		- static array indices.
		- restricted pointers - keyword restrict.
