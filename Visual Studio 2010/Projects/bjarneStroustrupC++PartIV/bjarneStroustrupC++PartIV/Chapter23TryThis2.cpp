Unix:

Unix is a computer Operating System which is capable of handling activities from multiple users at the same time.
The development of Unix started around 1969 at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's
internals is called the operating system or the kernel.
Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell.

Unix command: grep: print line matching a pattern.

Synxtax: 

grep [optional switches] PATTERN [FILE...]  
grep [optional switches] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...] 

Description: 
searches the named input FILEs  
(or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) 
for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN. By default, grep prints the matching lines.

AWK:  is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
	  It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language
	  consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used
	  as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports.

Perl -  is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.
		The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed.
		They provide powerful text processing facilities, facilitating easy manipulation of text files.
		A CGI scripting language, in part due to its (then) unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.
		Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance, bioinformatics, and other applications, 
		such as for GUIs.

WG21 -  Standard Committee Papers:
		ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22 Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces is a standardization
		subcommittee of the Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1 of the International Organization for Standardization 
		(ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), that develops and facilitates standards within the
		fields of programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces.

John Maddock - a software developer from England and holds a PhD in Chemistry, 
			   but found that computers smell less and explode less often!
			   John is the author of the regex++ regular expression package, 
			   has an almost pathological interest in anything that "can't be done".

Boost libraries - Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. 
			      Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications.
