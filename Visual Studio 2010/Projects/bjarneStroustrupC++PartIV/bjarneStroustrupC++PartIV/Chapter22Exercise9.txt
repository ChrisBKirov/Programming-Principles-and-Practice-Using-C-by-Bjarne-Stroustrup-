What is C used for and why?

from The C Programming Language (K & R)

C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression, modern
flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. Its absence of restrictions 
and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.
C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC
PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie.


Generally it is mostly used in low and middle level programming, near the machine hardware, with more direct access
to memory and other resources. The main areas of C applications are:

Operating Systems	
Network 
Drivers	
Print Spoolers
Language Compilers	
Assemblers	
Text Editors
Modern Programs	Data Bases	
Language Interpreters
Simulators	
Utilities	
Embedded System

More specifically:

Linux kernel,
OS X kernel, 
Bash, 
Bind, 
Apache, 
nginx, 
lighttpd, 
OpenSSH, 
UNIX kernel, most (all?) of older UNIX userland, 
most of older BSD userland, 
GNU Binutils, 
Doom, Quake, 
parts of Git, 
almost all hardware drivers (except the ones written in assembly), 
Perl's reference implementation, 
the main Python implementation, 
Ruby's reference implementation, 
gcc prior to 2010, 
Netscape Navigator, 
Marble Madness, 
SimCity, 
AmigaOS, 
most embedded software in automobiles (control systems)
