	"Software - Principles and Practice using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup"
	COMMENT
			Objective: Implement reassignment for the used defined variables.
					   Already provided in all of the previous exercises.
					   
					   Advantages of reassignment:
					   - the existence of non-const variables, i.e.
					   variables that could be assigned value after definition.

					   Possible source of errors during reassignment:

					   1. In case we want to define new variable, but:
							- forget the keyword "let"
							- forget that there is an existent varaible with the same name.
						  Instead of defining new variable we will override the existent.
