 19. Modify the previous exercise to allow the user to mark rooms on the map based on knowledge and guesses, such as _"maybe bats"_ and _"bottomless pit"_.
 20. Define a vector so `sizeof( vector<int> )== sizeof( int * )`, that is, the vector itself consists only of a pointer to a representation consisting of the elements, the number of elements, and the `space` pointer.

 22. Modify the solution to the previous exercise to use `0` to represent the (non- existent) one-past-the-end `Link (list<Elem> ::end())`; that way the size of empty list is equal to the size of simple pointer.
 23. Define a singly-linked list, `slist`, in the style of `std::list`. Which operations from `List` should be kept?  
 24. Define a `pvector` to be like `vector` of pointers except that it contains pointer to objects and its destructor deletes each object.
 25. Define an `ownership_vector` that holds pointers to objects like `pvector`, but provides a mechanism for the user to decide which objects are owned by the vector (i.e., which objects are `delete`d by the destructor).
 26. Define a range-checked iterator for `vector` (a random-access iterator).
 27. Define a range-checked iterator for `list` (a bidirectional iterator).
 28. Compare `vector` and `list`. Generate _N_ random `int` numbers in the range _[0, N)_. As each `int` is generated. insert it into a  `vector` of `int`.

18. Define an `Order` class with (customer) `name`, `address`, `data` and `vector` of `Purchase` members. `Purchase` is a class with (product) `name`, `unit prince`, and `count members`. Define a mechanism for reading and writing to and from file. Define a mechanism for printing orders. Create a file of at least 10 orders, read it into a `vector` of `Order`, sort it by name (of customer), and write it back to file.

Use this program to draw improved versions of the diagrams in ยง22.2.2 and ยง22.2.7.

1. Try this 1: What would be a better error handling? Modify Mail_file's constructor to handle likely formatting errors related to the use of "----" - (end of message indicator).
2. Try this 2: Write a brief explanation of the new terms used in the current section of the chapter.

4. Drill: Find out if `regex` is shipped as part of your standard library. Try: `std::regex` and `tr1::regex`. Get the program from ยง23.7.7 to run. Install boost library; set project options; and include needed headers. Use the program to test the pattern from ยง23.7.
5. Exercise 1: Get the Mail_file example to run with file of your creation. Be sure to test with error-causing messages, such as: ones with two addresses, multiple messages with same addresses or same subject, and empty message. Test with file containing something that is not a message, such as a file containing only ....
6. Add a `multimap` and have it hold subjects. Let the program take an input string from the keyboard and print out every message with that string as its subject.

8. Apply the previous program on real list of emails and extract the lines containing the subject.
9. Compare `std::multimap` against `std::unordered_multimap`, having in mind that the latter doesn't take advantage of ordering.

12. Write a program that finds a pattern in a file and displays the line containing the pattern and its number.
13. Using `eof()` (ยงB.7.2), it is possible to determine which line of a table is the last. Use that to (try to) simplify the table-checking program from ยง23.9. Be sure to test your program with files that end with empty lines after the table and with files that don't end with a newline at all.
14. Modify the table-checking program from ยง23.9 to write a new table where the rows with the same initial digit are merged.

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

1. Try this 1: sum a the fraction `1/n` `n` times and observe the result. Is it `1`? Rounding Error.
2. Try this 2: Run the examples from ยง24.2 showing truncation, overflow and underflow examples due to intertype assignments, implicit conversion and algebraic calculations.
3. Drill 1: Print the size of a `char`, a `short`, an `int`, a `long`, a `float`, a `double`, an `int*`, and a `double*`. (use `sizeof`, not `limits`).
4. Drill 2: Print out the size as reported by `sizeof` of Matrix of `int`: `a(10)`, Matrix of int: `b(10)`, Matrix of double: `c(10)`, 2D Matrix of int: `d(10,10)`, 3D Matrix of int: `e(10, 10, 10)`.
5. Drill 3: Print out the elements of the matrices from the previous exercise.
6. Drill 4:  Write a program that takes ints from d n and outputs the `sqrt()` of each `int`, or "no square root" if `sqrt(x)` is illegal for `some` x (i.e., check your `sqrt()` return values).
7. Drill 5: Read ten floating-point values from input and put them into a `Matrix` of `double`. Matrix has no `push_back()` so be careful to handle an attempt to enter a wrong number of doubles. Print out the `Matrix`.
8. Drill 6: Compute a multiplication table for `[O, n) x [O,m)` and represent it as a 2D Matrix. Take `n` and `m` from `std::cin` and print out the table nicely (assume that `m` is small enough that the results fit on a line). 
9. Drill 7: Read ten `complex` of `double`s from `std::cin` and put them into a `Matrix`. Calculate and output the sum of the ten `complex` numbers.
10. Drill 8:  Read six `int`s into a `2D Matrix` of `int`, `m(2, 3)` and print them out.
11. The function arguments `f` for `a.apply(f)` and `apply(f,a)` are different. Write a `double()` function for each and use each to double the elements of an array `{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }`. Define a single `double()` function that can be used for both `a.apply(double)` and `apply(double, a)`. Explain why it could be a bad idea to write every function to be used by `apply()` that way.
12. Do, the previous, Exercise 1 again, but with _function objects_, rather than functions. 
13. Write an `apply(f,a)` that can takes a `void f(T&)`, a `T f(const T&)`, and their function object equivalents. Hint: `Boost::bind`.
14. Get the Gaussian elimination program to work; that is, complete it, get it to compile, and test it with a simple example. 
15. Try the Gaussian elimination program with `A={ {O 1} {1 O} }` and `b={ 5 6 }` and watch it fail. Then, try `elim_with_partiat_pivot()`.
16.  In the Gaussian elimination example, replace the vector operations `dot_product()` and `scale_and_add()` with loops. Test, and comment on the clarity of the code.
17. Rewrite the Gaussian elimination program without using the Matrix library; that is, use built-in arrays or vectors instead of Matrices.
18. Animate the Gaussian Elimination. 
19. Rewrite the non-member `apply()` functions to return a `Matrix` of the return type of the function applied that is, `apply(f, a)` should return a `Matrix` of type `R` where `R` is the return type of `f`. Warning: The solution requires information about templates not available in this book. 
20. How random is your `rand()`? Write a program that takes two integers `n` and `d` as inputs and calls `randint(n)` `d` times, recording the result. Output the number of draws for each of `[0 : n)` and "eyeball" how similar tile counts are. Try with low values for `n` and with low values for `d` to see if drawing only a few random numbers causes obvious biases. 
21. Write a `swap_columns()` to match `swap_rows()` from ยง24.S.3. Obviously, to do that you have to read and understand some of the existing `Matrix` library code. Don't worry too much about efficiency: it is not possible to get `swap_columns()` to run as fast as `swap_rows()`.
22. Implement: `Matrix operator multiplication (2DMatrix&, 1DMatrix&);`, i.e. tensor-vector dot product and `Matrix operator+ (Matrix&, Matrix&);` for randomly multidimensional matrices. 

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

1. Try This 1: Replace `333` in the example with `10` and run the example again. What result would you expect? What result did you get? 
2. ะขry This 2: Before reading further, try to see how many errors you can find in `f()` in ยง25.4.3. Specifically, which of the calls of `poor()` could cause the program to crash?
3. Try This 3: Get the bits example to work and try out a few values to develop a feel for binary and hexadecimal representations. If you get confused about the representation of negative values, just try again after reading ยง25.5.3.  
4. Try This 4: Inspect the loop in ยง25.5.3 with signed `char` as loop variable and `unsigned char` as termination variable. Why it's infinite?
5. Try This 5: Draw out the bit patterns on a piece or paper. Using paper, then figure out what the answer would be for `si = 128` in ยง25.5.3. Then run the program to see if your machine agrees. 
6. Drill 1: Bit shifting and multiplication.
7. Drill 2: Unsigned short Bit manipulations.
8. Exercise 1: Do Try This Exercise.
9. Hexspeak.
10. Integer bit patterns.
11. Add the bitwise logical operators `&`, `|`, `^` , and `~` to the calculator from Chapter 7. 
12. Write an infinite loop. Execute it. 
13. Write an infinite loop that is hard to recognize as an infinite loop. A loop that isn't really infinite because it terminates after completely consuming some resource is acceptable.  
14. Write out the hexadecimal values from `0` to `400`; and from `-200` to `200`.
15. Write out the numerical values of each character on your keyboard.
16. Without using any standard headers (such as `limits` or documentation, compute the number of bits in an `int` and determine whether `char` is `signed` or `unsigned` on your implementation. 
17. Look at the bitfield example from ยง25.5.5. Write an example that initializes a `PPN`, then reads and prints each field value, then changes each field value (by assigning the field), and prints the result. Repeat this exercise, but store the `PPN` information in a 32-bit `unsigned` integer and use bit manipulation operators (ยง25.5.4) to access the bits in the word. 
18. Redo previous exercise using `bitset`.
19. Write out the clear text of the example from ยง25.5.6. 
20. Implement a simple `vector` that can hold at most `N` elements allocated from a pool. Test it for `N == 1000` and `integer` elements.  
21. Measure the time it takes to de / allocate `10000` objects of random sizes in `[10000:0)` - byte range. Do this twice: once deallocate in reverse order and once deallocate in random order.
22. Formulate 20 coding style rules (don't just copy those in ยง25.6). Apply them to a program of more than 300 lines that you recently wrote.
23. Proof that `Array_ref` handles inheritance correctly by trying to get a `Rectangle\*` into `std::vector<Circle\*>` using `Array_ref<Shape\*>`, without using casts or other operations involving undefined behaviour.


<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

1. Implement a _Binary Search_ algorithm by yourself. How do you know it is correct? 
2. Drill 1: Implement the input operator for `Test` from ยง26.3.2.2.
3. Drill 2: Complete a file of tests for the sequences from ยง26.3: empty sequence, single element, odd and even number, equal elements, different elements at end.
4. Drill 3: Based on ยง26.3.2.3, complete a program that generates (ordered): a very large sequence, ten sequences with random number of elements, ten sequences with elements: `0,1,2,...,9` random elements.
5. Drill 4: Repeat these tests for sequences of strings, such as: `{ Bohr Darwin Einstein Lavoisier Newton Turing }`.
6. Exercise 1: Run your binary search algorithm from ยง26.1 wilt the tests presented in ยง26.3.2.1.
7. Modify the testing of `binary_search()` to deal with arbitrary element types. Then, test it with `std::string` sequences and `float` sequences.
8. Repeat the exercise in ยง26.2.1 with the version of `binary_search` that takes a comparison criterion. Make a list of new opportunities for errors introduced by that extra argument.
9. Devise a format for test data so that you can define a sequence once and run several tests against.
10. Add a test to the set of `binary_search` tests to try to catch the (unlikely) error of a `binary_search` modifying the sequence.
11. Modify the calculator from _Chapter 7_ minimally to let it take input from a file and produce output to a file (or use your operating system's facilities for redirecting I/O ). Then devise a reasonably comprehensive test for it. 
12. Test the "simple text editor" from ยง20.6. 
13. Add a text-based interface to the graphics interface library from Chapters 12 - 15. For example, the string: "Circle(Point(O, 1), 15)" should generate a call `Circle(Point(O, 1), 15)`. Use this text interface to make a "kid 's drawing" of a two-dimensional house with a roof, two windows, and a door.
14. Add a text-based output format for the graphics interface library. For example, when a call `Circle(Point(0,1),15)` is executed, a string like: "Circle(Point(0,1),15)" should be produced on an output stream.
15. Use the text-based interface from Exercise 9 to write a better test for the graphical interface library.
16. Time the sum example from ยง26.6 with `m` being square matrices with dimensions `100`, `10.000`, `1.000.000`, and `10.000.000`. Use random element values in the range `[-10: 10)`. Rewrite the calculation of `v` to use a more efficient (not O(n^2)) algorithm and compare the timings.  
17. Write a program that generates random floating-point numbers and sorts them using `std::sort`. Measure the time used to sort `500,000` doubles and `5,000,000` doubles.  
18. Write a program that generates random length, within `[0,100)`, `std::string`s and sorts them using `std::sort`. Measure the time used to sort `500,000` and `5,000,000` strings. 
19. Repeat the previous exercise, except using a `std::map` rather than a `std::vector` so that we don't need to sort.

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

1. Try This 1: Test `cat()`. Why `2`? We left a beginner's performance error in `cat()`; find it and remove it. We "forgot" to comment our code. Add comments suitable for someone who can be assumed to know the standard C - string functions. 
2. Is this implementation of `strcpy()` correct? Explain why.
3. Rewrite the intrusive list example in C++, showing how to make it shorter and easier to use without making the code slower or the objects bigger. 
4. Drill 1: Write a `"Hello, World!"` program in C, compile it, and run it.  
5. Define two variables holding `"Hello"` and `"World!"` respectively; concatenate them with a space in between; and output them as `Hello, World!`.
6. Define a C function that takes a `char*` parameter `p` and an `int` parameter `x` and prints out their values in this format: `p` is `"foo"` and `x` is `7`. Call it with a few argument pairs. 
7. Exercise 1: Implement versions of `strlen()`, `strcmp()`, and `strcpy()`.
8. Complete the intrusive list example in ยง27.9 and test it using every function.
9. "Pretty up" the intrusive list example in ยง27.9 as best you can to make it convenient to use. Do catch / handle as many error's as you can. It is fair game to change the details of the `struct` definitions, to use macros, whatever.
10. If you didn't already, write a C++ version of the intrusive list example in ยง27.9 and test it using every function.
11. Compare the results of Exercises 3 and 4.
12. Change the representation of `Link` and `List` from ยง27.9 without changing the user interface provided by the functions. Allocate `Link`s in an array of `Link`s and have the members: `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` be `int`s (indices into the array).  
13. What are the advantages and disadvantages of intrusive containers compared to C++ standard (non-intrusive) containers? Make lists of pros and cons. 
14. What is the lexicographical order on your machine? Write out every character on your keyboard together with its integer value; then, write the characters out in the order determined by their integer value.
15. Using only C facilities, including the C standard library, read a sequence of words from stdin and write them to stdout in lexicographical order. Hint: The C sort function is called `qsort()`; look it up somewhere. Alternatively, insert the words into an ordered list as you read them. There is no C standard library list.
16. Make a list of C language features adopted from C++ or C with Classes (ยง27.1). 
17. Make a list of C language features not adopted by C++.
18. Implement a (C-style string, `int`) lookup table with operations such as `find (struct table*, const char*)`, `insert (struct table*, const char*, int)`, and `remove (struct table*, const char*)`. The representation of the table could be an array of a struct pair or a pair of arrays (`const char* []` and `int*`); you choose. Also choose return types for your functions. Document your design decisions.  
19. Write a program that does the equivalent of `string s`; `cin >> s`; in C; that is, define an input operation that reads an arbitrarily long sequence of white space - terminated characters into a zero - terminated array of `char`s.
20. Write a function that takes an array of `int`s as its input and finds the smallest and the largest elements; It should also compute the median and mean. Use a `struct` holding the results as the return value.
21. Simulate single inheritance in C. Let each "base class" contain a pointer to an array of pointers to functions (to simulate virtual functions as free standing functions taking a pointer to a "base class" object as their first argument); see ยง27.2.3. Implement "derivation" by making the "base class" the type of the first member of the derived class. For each class, initialize the array of "virtual functions" appropriately. To test the ideas, implement a version of "the old Shape example" with the base and derived `draw()` just printing out the name of their class. Use only language features and library facilities available in standard C.
22. Use macros to obscure (simplify the notation for) the implementation in the previous exercise.

Names of _variables_ and _functions_ start with lower case and contain upper case or underscore `"_"`, in case of complex names; _classes_ and _namespaces_ start with upper case. Example:

<pre>

namespace MyExample 
{

    int var;

    int func (int par);
    
    int res_var;
    
    class ObjectOriented
    {
    
    };

}

</pre>


File organization:
---

1.Main (Execution) files, `FileName.cpp`, contain the included compiler libraries<br>
   and custom libraries, followed by the `main()` function;<br> 
   Global variables are avoided.

2.Header files, `FileName.h` contain guards using the file name in upper case:

<pre>
#ifnded FILE_NAME_H
#define FILE_NAME_H

// declarations

#include "FileNameDef.cpp"
#endif
</pre>

3.Implementation files `FileNameDef.cpp` contain class/function implementations,<br>
  separated either by:

`----------------------------`<br>

or 

`===========================` <br>

with comments before the body of definition:

<pre>
/*
    Function:
    Use:
    
    Description
*/
</pre>

Files naming convention:
---

`Chapter[number]TryThis[number].cpp`
